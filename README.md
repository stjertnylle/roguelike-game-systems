# roguelike-game-systems

This is a group project done as part of a university course. The purpose of the project was to learn how to use a unit testing framework (JUnit), as well as try out other tools like build scripts (Maven), VCS (Git), Build servers (Jenkins) etc.  

In order to have something to test we created some classes representing different parts of a roguelike game, like monsters, player, inventory, combatsystem, magic system, items etc. We have not actually created a full game though, far from it, and there is no user interface.
